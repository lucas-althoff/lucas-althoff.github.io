This is Lucas Althoff's home on the web!

At present I am working on a doctoral thesis in the research area of Saliency Prediction on 360° Videos, applied technologies like Virtual Reality and Machine Learning are some of the possible interesting applications of my work.

I am also working in a research project [PES360](https://lucas-althoff.github.io/portfolio/pes360) about editing technics to improve 360° videos streaming, which are related directly to my thesis work. 

Please refer to my [CV](https://lucas-althoff.github.io/cv/), or my socialmedias, if you have interest to make some fruitful colab.
Get in touch via e-mail for professional and academic proposes, as well as, for research and development collaborations.

Research Interest
======
*	Spherical video processing, visual attention, saliency prediction, machine learning;
* Multimedia, video editing, video storytelling, cinematography; (Audio Visual)
*	Computational physics, astrophysics, spectral analysis;  
*	STEAM teaching and learning, multidisciplinary teamwork, creative thinking; (Scientific democratization)
*	Project management, business process, 4.0 industry technology. (BPM Consultant)

Hobbies
======
I understand that science and art can become a powerful tool to overcome inequality in the world,
turning science less boring and art even more expansive. 
Contributing with **Audiovisual Projects** (as well as other cultural projects) is a personal goal, which I'd could collaborate to 
bring a positive social impact by making use of the technical knowledge developed in academic context.
