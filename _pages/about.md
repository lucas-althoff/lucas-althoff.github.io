Hobbies
======
I understand that science and art can become a powerfull tool to overcome inequality in the word,
turning science less boring and art even more expansive. I have a personal goal to contribute 
in **Audiovisual Projects** (as well as other cultural projects) 
which I could collaborate to bring a positive social impact by making use of the technical knowledge 
developed in academic context.
