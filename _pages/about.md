This is Lucas Althoff's home on the web!

At present I am working on a doctoral thesis in the research area of Saliency Prediction on 360° Videos, applied technologies like Virtual Reality and Machine Learning are some of the possible interesting applications of my work.

I am also working in a research project (PES360)[https://lucas-althoff.github.io/portfolio/pes360] about editing technics to improve 360° videos streaming, which are related directly to my thesis work. 

Please refer to my CV, or my socialmedias, if you have interest to make some fruitful colab.
Get in touch via e-mail for professional and academic proposes, as well as, for research and development collaborations.

Hobbies
======
I understand that science and art can become a powerful tool to overcome inequality in the world,
turning science less boring and art even more expansive. 
Contributing with **Audiovisual Projects** (as well as other cultural projects) is a personal goal, which I'd could collaborate to 
bring a positive social impact by making use of the technical knowledge developed in academic context.
